### Session 5 – 2026-04-11
**Focus:** Product-depth track – RIASEC hexagon widget, resume-on-reload, Pinia store tests

**Meta / process notes:**
- Three-PR session following the "branch off fresh main, edit-test-iterate live via HMR, commit only after user approval" workflow from Session 4's memory. Earlier PRs in the session shipped with NO `SUMMARY.md` change; this Session 5 entry rides with the final PR of the session and retrospectively covers all three.
- New convention adopted this session: **do not include PR URLs in SUMMARY entries.** PR URLs aren't known at commit time (the SUMMARY commit ships as part of the same branch that becomes the PR), and editing after opening the PR is blocked by the "approved PRs are frozen" rule. Reference PRs by verb ("the hexagon widget PR") or commit hash when needed.

**What was done — PR #8 (RIASEC hexagon widget):**
- New widget `src/widgets/riasec-chart/ui/RiasecHexagon.vue` – dependency-free inline SVG in the standard Holland hexagon order (R-I-A-S-E-C clockwise from top at 60° intervals), grid rings at 25/50/75/100 %, axis labels showing letter + percent, and a filled polygon for the user profile. Scales fluidly via `viewBox` + `w-full`. Barrel export from `src/widgets/riasec-chart/index.ts`.
- `ResultsPage.vue` swaps the six horizontal percent bars for the hexagon + a compact 3-column legend grid (3/2/1 col responsive) that preserves the German dimension descriptions from the i18n layer.
- **Also bundled in PR #8 (small layout fix found during browser test):** long German occupation titles overflowed their top-10 cards on narrow viewports. Classic flexbox `min-width: auto` trap – the title `<div>` couldn't shrink below its content width. Fix: `min-w-0 flex-1` on the title container, `shrink-0` on the fit-score, `break-words` on the text so long compound words wrap.
- Verified: `npm test` 32/32 ✅, type-check ✅, lint ✅, build ✅ (ResultsPage chunk 2.88 KB → 5.22 KB for the hexagon; store chunk unchanged at 600 KB).
- Browser-tested by @mo-sp: hexagon renders correctly, labels don't clip, responsive legend reflows 3→2→1 col, all-*Sehr gerne* profile fills, all-*Überhaupt nicht* profile → 20 % (expected – see findings below).

**What was done — PR #9 (resume on reload + header nav rename):**
- Added `hydrate()` to the questionnaire store and a persist-on-change `watch` around `[answers, currentIndex]` with `{ deep: true }`. `main.ts` calls `hydrate()` via **dynamic import** (`import('@features/questionnaire/model/store')`) only when `window.location.pathname` matches `/test` or `/ergebnis`, so a visitor who bounces off `/` still doesn't download the 600 KB occupations chunk. Landing on `/` always starts fresh.
- Removed the initial "length > 0" guard on the persist watcher so even empty resets get written to Dexie. Without this, reloading `/test` immediately after clicking *Test starten* (before answering) would hydrate the previous completed session as the "most recent by startedAt".
- Dynamic-import side effect: rolldown re-chunked `vue-router` (140 KB → 24 KB) and hoisted `pinia` into its own 115 KB chunk. Same total bytes for `/`, just a different split. Store chunk stayed at 600 KB and remained lazy.
- **Also bundled (found during browser test):** the header nav's `Start` label collided with the homepage *Test starten* CTA, AND the header `Test starten` link silently did NOT reset the store (unlike the homepage CTA's `@click="start"` path). Same label, different semantics. Renamed to `Startseite` + `Zum Test` so the labels match the actual behavior; unchanged underlying behavior.
- Verified: 32/32 ✅, type-check ✅, lint ✅, build ✅. Browser-tested: reload `/test` resumes at next unanswered question, reload `/ergebnis` after completion still shows results, the `→ Zum Test` interstitial button now resumes instead of restarting from question 1, and *Test starten* from home after completion correctly starts a fresh test.

**What was done — questionnaire store tests (this session's final PR):**
- Added `src/features/questionnaire/model/store.test.ts` with **17 new tests** exercising the Pinia store end-to-end against real `onet-items.json` + `onet-occupations.json` and a `fake-indexeddb` Dexie backend.
- Chose `fake-indexeddb/auto` as a **scoped import at the top of the test file** (not a global vitest setup file) so sibling tests keep their plain node environment and don't silently depend on an IDB global.
- **Action-layer block (6 tests):** initial state + `total === 10` guard, `answer()` advances + records, `answer()` overwrites a re-answered question without duplicating, `answer()` clamps at the last index (doesn't step off the end of the questions array), `previous()` clamps at 0, `reset()` clears answers + currentIndex + generates a new `sessionId`.
- **Computed-layer block (3 tests):** `riasecProfile` sums Likert responses per dimension against the known PoC distribution `R=2/I=2/A=2/S=2/E=1/C=1` (so answering all 10 with value 3 lands on exact counts `R=I=A=S=6, E=C=3`), `riasecPercent` normalization at max (every dim → 100), `results` empty-until-complete.
- **Persist-watcher block (3 tests):** writes in-progress session after an answer, writes `completedAt` + `riasecProfile` + `results` once the session is complete, empty `reset()` overrides the previous completed session as "latest by startedAt" – the specific behavior that lets `hydrate()` find a fresh state after a double *Test starten* click.
- **Hydrate block (5 tests):** restores an in-progress session and advances `currentIndex` to the next unanswered question, restores a complete session and clamps `currentIndex` to `total-1` (prevents stepping off the questions array), no-op on empty Dexie, picks the most recent session by `startedAt` regardless of insertion order (`bulkPut([old, newer])` still hydrates `newer`), second call is a no-op so intervening user input is not clobbered.
- Small helper `flushPersist()` – `2× nextTick()` + `2× setTimeout(0)`. Overkill for fake-IDB's write speed but keeps the tests stable without polling for state. 17/17 green on first run after fixing one TS error where the initial draft reached for `store.startedAt` which isn't exposed in the store's public return block.
- Verified: `npm test` → **49/49** ✅ (32 from prior sessions + 17 new), type-check ✅, lint ✅, build ✅. No runtime/bundle delta – pure test-only addition. No browser test applicable.

**Session-wide findings / non-bugs noted for the record:**
- **Likert minimum = 20 %, not 0 %.** Scale is 1-5, so the minimum response maps to `1×count / (5×count) = 20%`. The math at `src/features/scoring/lib/riasec.ts:37` is working as designed; matching uses the raw profile (not percent) so ranking is unaffected. Noted so future sessions don't "fix" it.
- **Narrow-viewport limit is the browser's own minimum window width (~500 px), not an app bug.** The hexagon + legend scale fluidly down to that limit. Use DevTools device mode for smaller widths.
- **Resume-on-reload is best-effort, not transactional.** If Dexie is unavailable (private mode, quota exceeded), `hydrate()` and the persist watcher silently swallow the error and the store stays in its pristine in-memory state. The user continues uninterrupted but loses the resume feature.
- **One narrow edge case accepted on PR #9:** reloading `/test` immediately after clicking *Test starten* from the homepage without answering any questions. The empty-reset persist covers it, but the user explicitly marked it as low-priority if it flakes.

**Branches / merge commits:**
- `feat/riasec-hexagon-widget` – hexagon widget + top-10 overflow fix, merged as `d6479f4`
- `feat/resume-on-reload` – resume on reload + header nav rename, merged as `f427487`
- `test/questionnaire-store` – this session's final PR, carries this SUMMARY entry

**Known issues / TODOs:**
- Bundle-size warning (~600 KB `store` chunk) **unchanged** since Session 2. The store chunk is already lazy-loaded for the `/` route (via page imports + PR #9's dynamic import for hydration), but on `/test` or `/ergebnis` the whole 600 KB / 169 KB gz chunk still loads as a single unit. The cleanest remaining fix is extracting `onet-occupations.json` out of the store chunk into its own lazy import inside the matcher, so `/test` (which only needs questions) doesn't pay for the occupations payload.
- 50 of 60 O*NET items still English-only. Deferred because native German judgment is needed per item – better as a dedicated back-and-forth session.
- No tests yet for the Dexie persistence layer directly (the store tests indirectly exercise it via fake-indexeddb).
- No component-level tests yet for `AssessmentPage`, `ResultsPage`, or `HomePage`.
- Resume-on-reload does not yet handle a "start a new test from /test after completion" flow distinctly from "continue test" – navigating `/test` after completion via the header's *Zum Test* link would show the last completed question. HomePage's `Test starten` CTA is the only fresh-start entry point.
- Still no Phase 1 MVP ship items: domain decision, free-tier hosting deploy, Spenden-Seite (Bitcoin/PayPal), Impressum/Datenschutz/Über pages, responsive audit.

**Next steps – product-depth track (continued):**
- Translate the remaining 50 O*NET items to German (dedicated session – needs native review per item).
- Extract `onet-occupations.json` out of the store chunk into its own lazy import inside the matcher.
- Add component-level tests for the assessment flow (`AssessmentPage` + `ResultsPage` rendering against a test store).

**Next steps – ship-it track (still untouched):**
- Domain decision + first hosting deploy (Cloudflare Pages / Vercel).
- Spenden-Seite: Bitcoin on-chain + Lightning + PayPal.
- Impressum / Datenschutz / Über pages (required before any public launch in DE).
- Responsive design audit across common mobile/tablet breakpoints.

### Session 4 – 2026-04-11
**Focus:** Routing bugfix for *Test neu starten* on `/ergebnis` + scoring pipeline integration tests against real O*NET data

**Meta / process refinements:**
- Clarified that on the dev-sandbox, Vite HMR serves filesystem edits to the user's browser immediately — git commits, branches, and pushes are purely for version control, not for "making changes visible". Previous sessions were implicitly conflating the two, which caused this session's own early mistake: after pushing the routing fix, the assistant branched off `main` for the integration-tests work, silently reverting `ResultsPage.vue` on disk and breaking the live fix the user was about to browser-test. Fixed in place; memory (`feedback_test_before_pr.md`) rewritten so future sessions edit-test-iterate-live and only commit/branch/push after user approval.
- Clarified SUMMARY.md discipline: **one entry per session, rides with the final PR only.** Multi-PR sessions do NOT fragment the session log across PRs. Earlier PRs in the session ship with no SUMMARY change. Memory (`feedback_summary_timing.md`) rewritten accordingly. This Session 4 entry ships in PR #7 and covers both PR #6 and PR #7.

**What was done — PR #6 (routing fix):**
- Traced the *Test neu starten* bug from Session 3's TODO list. Root cause: the button on `ResultsPage.vue` called `store.reset()` directly, clearing answers but leaving the user on `/ergebnis`. `isComplete` flipped to `false`, the `v-if="!store.isComplete"` branch at the top of the page rendered the *Du hast den Test noch nicht abgeschlossen* interstitial, and the user had to click an extra `→ Zum Test` link to actually start over.
- Fix: introduce a component-local `async function restart() { store.reset(); await router.push('/test') }` and bind the button to `restart`. The identical `@click="store.reset"` on `AssessmentPage` is **not** touched — it already lives at `/test`, so an in-place reset is correct there.
- Verified: browser-tested on the dev-sandbox by @mo-sp (click *Test neu starten* → direct to question 1, no interstitial, URL changes to `/test`, progress bar shows `1/10`, no console errors).

**What was done — PR #7 (scoring pipeline integration tests):**
- Added `src/features/matching/lib/matcher.integration.test.ts` with 8 new tests exercising the real scoring pipeline against `src/data/onet-occupations.json` (923 occupations) and `src/data/onet-items.json` (60 items). Complements but does not overlap the existing unit tests from Session 3.
- **Matcher-only** block (5 tests, synthesized `RIASECProfile` → matcher, no scoring layer):
  - top-20 sanity (length 20, monotonic desc by `fitScore`, well-formed `rank` 1..20, `fitScore ∈ [-1, 1]`)
  - identity check: fed Software Developers' own profile, matcher ranks `15-1252.00` first with `fitScore ≈ 1.0`
  - pure-Social `{R:1,I:1,A:1,S:5,E:1,C:1}` → ≥ 9/10 of top-10 in major group `25` (Education). Actual: 10/10.
  - pure-Realistic → ≥ 8/10 in `{37, 45, 47}` (Grounds / Agriculture / Construction). Actual: 10/10.
  - pure-Enterprising → ≥ 7/10 in `{11, 41}` (Management / Sales). Actual: 8/10.
- **Full pipeline** block (3 tests, `Answer[]` → `computeRiasecProfile` → `matchOccupations`):
  - dominant-I answers on the **PoC 10** items → ≥ 8/10 of top-10 in `{15, 19}` (Science / Math). Actual: 10/10.
  - dominant-I answers on the **full 60** items → identical assertion passes against the identical helper fed a larger item subset. Actual: 10/10. This is the forward-compat claim @mo-sp asked about at the start of the session: **scaling the questionnaire from 10 → 60 items requires no test changes.**
  - helper length check: asserts `makeRiasecAnswers(items, perDim, default)` emits exactly one `Answer` per riasec item in its input subset, and explicitly guards against the PoC silently growing to match the full item set.
- Key design choice: `makeRiasecAnswers(items: Question[], perDim, defaultValue = 3)` takes the item list as input and never hardcodes IDs or counts. Same helper runs both the 10-item and 60-item tests. Assertions are ≥ bounds (`≥ 7`/`≥ 8`/`≥ 9`) rather than exact ranks so future O*NET data refreshes that nudge a handful of occupations around do not spuriously break the suite — actual counts today have 1-3 occupations of headroom on every assertion.
- Verified: `npm test` → **32/32** passing (24 from Session 3 + 8 new), `npm run type-check` ✅, `npm run lint` ✅, `npm run build` ✅ (pre-existing 600 KB store-chunk warning unchanged). No browser test applicable — pure test-only addition, no UI impact.

**Commits / PRs:**
- Branch: `fix/results-restart-navigation` (off fresh `main` post-PR #5 merge)
  - `062cf82` fix(results): navigate to /test on restart to avoid interstitial
  - **PR mo-sp/pathfinder#6** → https://github.com/mo-sp/pathfinder/pull/6
- Branch: `test/scoring-integration` (off fresh `main`, independent of PR #6)
  - `19e0d18` test(scoring): add integration tests against real O*NET data
  - *(this SUMMARY commit)* docs(summary): add Session 4 entry for restart fix + integration tests
  - **PR mo-sp/pathfinder#7** → https://github.com/mo-sp/pathfinder/pull/7

**Known issues / TODOs:**
- Bundle-size warning (~600 KB `store` chunk) still unchanged since Session 2. Lazy-loading `onet-occupations.json` remains the cleanest fix and is now the oldest carry-over TODO.
- 50 of 60 O*NET items still only have English text.
- No tests yet for the Pinia `questionnaire` store (Session 4 added a helper that *would* feed it synthesized answers, but the store itself is still untested), the Dexie persistence layer, or any component/integration test. Still deferred.
- The new integration tests exercise the real data but **only** the pure-function layer (`computeRiasecProfile`, `matchOccupations`). A full Pinia-level store test still isn't here.
- One of the integration tests only gets 8/10 top-10 occupations in expected families for pure-Enterprising (tight against the `≥ 7` bound). If O*NET refreshes drop this by two more, the assertion will start flaking. Not urgent but worth a note.

**Next steps:**
- Replace the RIASEC bar chart with a proper hexagon/radar widget under `widgets/riasec-chart/`.
- Lazy-load `onet-occupations.json` out of the main store chunk.
- Translate the remaining 50 O*NET items to German.
- Eventually add Pinia-level questionnaire store tests (probably with `@pinia/testing`).

### Session 3 – 2026-04-11
**Focus:** Vitest setup + unit tests for `pearson.ts`, `riasec.ts`, `matcher.ts` (plus stacked-PR recovery)

**Meta / recovery:**
- Discovered that PR #2 (`feat/esco-german-titles`) and PR #3 (`docs/session-summary-pr-links`) had merged into their stacked parent branches (`feat/poc-scaffold` and `feat/esco-german-titles` respectively) rather than into `main`, leaving `main` stuck at PR #1's state. ESCO German titles, the `build-esco-german.mjs` script, and the Testing & Review Workflow docs were all orphaned in feature branches. Root causes: (a) repo setting `delete_branch_on_merge = false`, so GitHub never auto-retargeted child PRs when a parent merged; (b) feature branches were cut from each other locally rather than from a freshly-pulled `main`, so `gh pr create` defaulted each PR's base to the immediate parent feature branch.
- **Fix:** opened a one-shot catch-up PR from `feat/esco-german-titles` → `main`. Normal merge, no rewrites, no force-pushes. Pulled 8 commits (PRs #2 + #3 content) onto `main` in one go.
  - **PR mo-sp/pathfinder#4** → https://github.com/mo-sp/pathfinder/pull/4
- **Prevention:** flipped repo setting to `delete_branch_on_merge = true` via `gh api -X PATCH repos/mo-sp/pathfinder -f delete_branch_on_merge=true`. Future stacked PRs will now auto-retarget to the grandparent base as parents merge. Also saved memory (`feedback_stacked_pr_hygiene.md`) so future sessions default to branching from a freshly-pulled `main`.

**What was done:**
- Installed `vitest@^4.1.4` as a dev dependency. Added `npm test` (one-shot, used by pre-PR checks) and `npm run test:watch` (interactive watch mode) scripts to `package.json`. Added a `test` block to `vite.config.ts` (node environment, `src/**/*.test.ts` include pattern) so the existing `@features/*` / `@entities/*` path aliases resolve in tests automatically.
- Wrote 24 unit tests across the three pure-logic modules that drive the scoring pipeline:
  - **`src/features/scoring/lib/pearson.test.ts`** (9 tests) – empty/mismatched-length inputs return 0; zero-variance guard (no NaN); identical and linearly-scaled inputs → +1; inverse inputs → −1; hand-computed known value (`[1..5]` vs `[2,4,5,4,5]` → ~0.7746); symmetry.
  - **`src/features/scoring/lib/riasec.test.ts`** (9 tests) – `computeRiasecProfile` per-dimension Likert sums, ignores non-riasec layer answers, ignores answers referencing unknown `questionId`, ignores riasec questions carrying an invalid dimension letter; `normalizeRiasecToPercent` percent math against item counts, zero-count safety (no divide-by-zero), integer rounding.
  - **`src/features/matching/lib/matcher.test.ts`** (6 tests) – identical user/occupation profile ranks that occupation first with `fitScore ≈ 1`, results sort strictly descending by `fitScore`, `rank` field assigned 1..N, `topN` slicing, empty list returns empty, occupation references preserved (no defensive cloning).
- First config attempt imported `defineConfig` from `'vitest/config'`. This silently broke Vite **dev-mode** alias resolution (every `@app`/`@shared` import in `src/main.ts` failed with `Failed to resolve import`) while leaving `npm run build` and `npm test` working. A second root-level `.vite/` cache directory also appeared alongside the usual `node_modules/.vite/` — `vitest/config`'s `defineConfig` seems to apply extra wrapping that interferes with Vite 8's environment-aware alias plumbing in the dev server. **Fix:** switch back to `defineConfig` from `'vite'` and declare the `test` block's type via a `/// <reference types="vitest/config" />` directive (the other pattern the vitest docs recommend). Manually verified with a curl against `/src/main.ts` on a temporary port — the transform returned the real file paths like `App from "/src/app/App.vue"`.
- Verified: `npm test` → 24/24 passing, `npm run type-check` ✅, `npm run lint` ✅, `npm run build` ✅ (existing 500 KB store-chunk warning unchanged), dev server on `--host` mode serves the questionnaire end-to-end with German occupation titles on the Results page (confirmed by @mo-sp in the browser before PR).

**Commits / PRs:**
- Branch: `feat/vitest-scoring-tests` (branched from `main` **after** PR #4 merged — truly clean base)
- `a67b922` chore(tests): set up vitest with node env and path aliases
- `ff3cdf6` test(scoring): add unit tests for pearson, riasec, and matcher
- `fe13b50` fix(vite): use defineConfig from 'vite' with triple-slash vitest type ref
- **PR mo-sp/pathfinder#5** → https://github.com/mo-sp/pathfinder/pull/5
- Related: **PR mo-sp/pathfinder#4** → https://github.com/mo-sp/pathfinder/pull/4 (catch-up merge that put PRs #2 + #3 onto `main`)

**Known issues / TODOs:**
- **"Test neu starten" routing bug** (spotted during Session 3 smoke test, pre-existing — not introduced here): clicking *Test neu starten* on the Results page after a completed assessment bounces to a "Du hast den Test noch nicht abgeschlossen" interstitial with a `> Zum Test` link, and only then starts a new run. It eventually works but the interstitial shouldn't appear on this path — likely an assessment-route guard that checks for an in-progress session too eagerly.
- Bundle-size warning (~600 KB `store` chunk) unchanged since Session 2. Lazy-loading `onet-occupations.json` is still the cleanest fix.
- 50 of 60 O*NET items still only have English text.
- No tests yet for the Pinia `questionnaire` store, the Dexie persistence layer, or any component/integration test. Deferred.
- No integration test yet that runs the full scoring pipeline against the real `src/data/onet-occupations.json` (e.g. an all-Investigative profile should rank software/science occupations in the top 10).

**Next steps:**
- Fix the "Test neu starten" interstitial routing bug (small, scoped).
- Replace the RIASEC bar chart with a proper hexagon/radar widget under `widgets/riasec-chart/`.
- Lazy-load `onet-occupations.json` out of the main store chunk.
- Add an integration test that exercises scoring + matching against the real occupations JSON.
- Translate the remaining 50 O*NET items to German.

### Session 2 – 2026-04-11
**Focus:** ESCO mapping → German occupation titles in `ResultsPage`

**What was done:**
- Researched the ESCO data ecosystem and located the official ESCO ↔ O*NET-SOC crosswalk CSV (`https://esco.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-08/ONET_(Occupations)_0_updated.csv`, ~3 MB, CC BY 4.0). 4 253 mappings, 4 210 to ESCO occupations + 43 to ISCO groups.
- Confirmed the public ESCO REST API (`https://ec.europa.eu/esco/api/resource/occupation?uri=…&language=de`) returns `preferredLabel.de` per occupation URI – the cleanest path to German labels without going through the email-gated ESCO classification CSV download.
- Added `csv-parse` as a dev dependency for robust CSV parsing (the crosswalk has many quoted descriptions with embedded commas/newlines).
- Wrote `scripts/build-esco-german.mjs` (`npm run build:esco`):
  - Auto-downloads the crosswalk into `data-raw/esco/` (gitignored)
  - Skips ISCO-namespace URIs (different API behavior)
  - Groups crosswalk rows by O*NET-SOC code, then picks the best ESCO match per code:
    1. highest match-type priority (`exactMatch > closeMatch > broadMatch > narrowMatch`)
    2. highest Jaccard token similarity to the O*NET English title (with a small English plural stemmer so `developer` matches `developers`)
    3. alphabetical tiebreak
  - Concurrently fetches German labels from the ESCO API in batches of 15
  - On-disk cache at `data-raw/esco/esco-de-cache.json` so re-runs are instant and offline-friendly
  - Patches `src/data/onet-occupations.json` in place, setting `escoUri` and `title.de`; occupations without a crosswalk match keep `de: null` and the UI keeps falling back to the English title
- First pass put "Software Developers" → "Datenbankentwickler" (alphabetical tiebreak picked the wrong sibling). Fixed by switching to Jaccard-with-stemming. Second pass put it on "Softwareentwickler für Embedded Systems" (overlap count couldn't distinguish parent from child). Final fix: Jaccard normalises by union size, so the shorter, more specific "Softwareentwickler/Softwareentwicklerin" wins.
- Final coverage: **890 / 923 occupations (96.4 %) now have a German title**. The remaining 33 are O*NET codes with no ESCO match in the official crosswalk (mostly very US-specific roles like Postmasters, Brownfield Redevelopment Specialists, Geothermal Production Managers).
- `ResultsPage` already had a `title.de || title.en` fallback with a "(Übersetzung folgt)" hint for the missing cases, so it picks up the new data automatically – no UI changes needed.
- Verified: `npm run type-check` ✅, `npm run lint` ✅, `npm run build` ✅ (store chunk grew from 484 KB → 600 KB raw / 130 KB → 169 KB gzipped due to the added German labels and `escoUri` fields), `npm run dev` boots and serves HTTP 200.

**Spot checks (ESCO crosswalk quality):**
- `15-1252.00 Software Developers` → Softwareentwickler/Softwareentwicklerin ✅
- `11-1011.00 Chief Executives` → Geschäftsführer/Geschäftsführerin ✅
- `47-2031.00 Carpenters` → Zimmerer/Zimmerin ✅
- `25-2021.00 Elementary School Teachers` → Lehrkraft im Primarbereich ✅
- `29-1141.00 Registered Nurses` → Krankenpfleger Allgemeine Krankenpflege/Krankenschwester Allgemeine Krankenpflege ✅
- `27-2042.00 Musicians and Singers` → Musiker/Musikerin ✅
- `13-2011.00 Accountants and Auditors` → Controller/Controllerin ⚠ (taxonomy mismatch in the source crosswalk – not a bug in the joiner)

**Commits / PRs:**
- Branch: `feat/esco-german-titles` (stacked on `feat/poc-scaffold`)
- `f13f6de` feat(scripts): add ESCO German title joiner
- `36df613` data(occupations): patch 890/923 occupations with German titles via ESCO
- `38c67fa` docs(claude.md): add Testing & Review Workflow section
- **PR mo-sp/pathfinder#2** → https://github.com/mo-sp/pathfinder/pull/2
  Stacked on #1; will auto-retarget to `main` once #1 merges. Manually browser-tested by @mo-sp before opening (German titles confirmed in ResultsPage).

**Known issues / TODOs:**
- Crosswalk-induced taxonomy mismatches: ~10–20 % of selected matches are conceptually adjacent rather than exact (e.g. "Accountants" → "Controller"). Improving this needs either (a) human curation, (b) running a similarity model on full descriptions instead of just titles, or (c) using the ESCO classification CSV bundle to score against alternate labels too.
- 33 O*NET codes still have no German title – worth a manual override list if/when they show up in user results.
- Bundle is now ~600 KB raw – the lazy-loading TODO from Session 1 is more urgent.
- Still no tests for `pearson.ts` / `riasec.ts` / `matcher.ts` – next on the list.

**Next steps:**
- PR review + merge for #1 and #2
- **Next session: add `vitest` + unit tests for `pearson.ts`, `riasec.ts`, `matcher.ts` plus a small integration test against the real `onet-occupations.json`** (user-chosen next step at the end of this session; branches off `main` so it doesn't depend on #1/#2)
- Lazy-load the occupations JSON out of the main store chunk
- Translate the remaining 50 O*NET items into German
- Replace bar chart with RIASEC hexagon widget under `widgets/riasec-chart/`
- Domain decision (per PROJECT_PLAN section 9) and pick a hosting target for first deploy

### Session 1 – 2026-04-11
**Focus:** Project scaffolding & Proof of Concept

**What was done:**
- Scaffolded Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite 8 project (npm create vite, then customised)
- Installed and wired up Pinia, Vue Router, Dexie, vue-i18n, Tailwind CSS v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite` plugin)
- Configured ESLint 9 flat config with `eslint-plugin-vue` + `typescript-eslint`
- Set up Feature-Sliced Design directory layout under `src/` (app, pages, widgets, features, entities, shared, data) plus path aliases in `tsconfig.app.json` and `vite.config.ts`
- Downloaded the O*NET Interest Profiler Short Form PDF (60 items, v1) and extracted all 60 items into `src/data/onet-items.json`
- Translated 10 PoC items to German (R=2, I=2, A=2, S=2, E=1, C=1) – flagged as draft, remaining 50 carry `de: null` until proper translation in MVP phase
- Downloaded O*NET DB 29.2 (text release) and wrote `scripts/build-onet-data.mjs` which extracts 923 occupations with their RIASEC OI profiles into `src/data/onet-occupations.json` (auto-downloads + unzips raw data into `data-raw/` if missing; raw dir is gitignored)
- Implemented core types in `entities/` (Question, Occupation, MatchResult, AssessmentSession)
- Implemented scoring (`features/scoring/lib/riasec.ts` – sum + percent normalisation), Pearson correlation (`features/scoring/lib/pearson.ts`), and matcher (`features/matching/lib/matcher.ts`)
- Implemented `features/questionnaire/model/store.ts` Pinia store using setup syntax – holds answers, current index, computed RIASEC profile, computed top-20 matches, and `persist()` to Dexie
- Built three pages with Tailwind: `HomePage`, `AssessmentPage` (10-item Likert flow with German labels via vue-i18n, progress bar, prev/restart), `ResultsPage` (RIASEC bar chart + top-10 occupation list with fit scores)
- Added O*NET attribution footer in `App.vue` per licence requirement
- Verified everything works: `npm run type-check` ✅, `npm run build` ✅ (Vite 8.0.8, ~700 KB total, ~135 KB gzipped), `npm run lint` ✅ (0 errors, 0 warnings), `npm run dev` boots and serves HTTP 200 on :5173

**Commits / PRs:**
- Branch: `feat/poc-scaffold`
- `c8a5828` docs: add project inception artifacts from planning session
- `705c93c` feat: scaffold Vue 3 PoC with 10-item RIASEC questionnaire
- **PR mo-sp/pathfinder#1** → https://github.com/mo-sp/pathfinder/pull/1

**Known issues / TODOs:**
- 50 of 60 O*NET items still need German translations (PoC ships only 10)
- 923 occupation titles are still English-only – need to wire up ESCO crosswalk for German titles (`esco-occupations-de.json`, `esco-onet-mapping.json` per CLAUDE.md / PROJECT_PLAN)
- `onet-occupations.json` (~495 KB raw, ~130 KB gzipped) is bundled into the main JS chunk via the Pinia store. Acceptable for PoC but should be lazy-loaded (e.g. `import('@data/onet-occupations.json')` inside the matcher) before MVP launch.
- PoC uses 10 items unevenly distributed across dimensions (E and C have only 1 item each). Pearson is scale-invariant so the ranking still works, but per-dimension percent on the ResultsPage is noisier than the full 60-item version will be.
- No tests yet – `vitest` should be added in next session before the scoring/matcher logic grows further.
- No widgets/ entries yet (e.g. RIASEC hexagon chart) – currently using simple bar visualisation.
- Tailwind v4 is used; CLAUDE.md mentions Vite 7 but `npm create vite@latest` installed Vite 8 – CLAUDE.md should be updated.

**Next steps:**
- Decide on branching/PR for this scaffold work and merge it
- Translate the remaining 50 O*NET items (reference: OPEN RIASEC opentest.ch, plus native review)
- Build out the ESCO mapping pipeline so German occupation titles render in `ResultsPage`
- Replace the bar chart with a proper RIASEC hexagon/radar widget under `widgets/riasec-chart/`
- Add `vitest` and unit tests for `pearson.ts`, `riasec.ts`, `matcher.ts`
- Lazy-load the occupations JSON to reduce initial bundle size
- Domain decision (per PROJECT_PLAN section 9) and choose hosting target for first deploy
